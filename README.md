A study case from Clean Code book. Chapter 14.

I was reading the Clean Code book and ran into this chapter where Uncle Bob guide us through a module he wrote.
Uncle Bob shows us how the code went from a "total mess" to a actual "clean code".

There's no doubts that Robert C. Martin is a brilliant programmer and his books are just as brilliant.
Still, I wanted to try and make that final code of his a little bit better. Just taking a few more steps to clean it up.

Feel free to take a look and make comments and/or suggestions :)
